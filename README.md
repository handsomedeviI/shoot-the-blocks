# Shoot the Blocks

Garbage little game I made in Clickteam when I was 11

This was extracted with Anaconda because I do not have the original MFA as of now (currently stuck on a corrupted hard drive)

kcini.mfx is a needed extension

Android.mfx is a needed extension (although it isn't used in any way)
