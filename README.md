# Shoot the Blocks

Garbage little game I made in Clickteam when I was 11.

This was extracted with Anaconda because I do not have the original MFA as of now (currently stuck on a corrupted hard drive).

kcini.mfx is a needed extension.

Android.mfx is a needed extension (although it isn't used in any way).

I have no idea what this game could've amounted to, although given that the Android object was present I suspect that I intended this to be more of a mobile game than a PC game. Mobile would've been the better platform for it by far, however I still think the game itself is quite boring as is. Maybe the concept could've been expanded further if I had enough knowledge on how to create games at the time. Maybe I'll add onto it someday and turn this into something, but I'm not sure.
